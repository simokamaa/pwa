Welcome to the [PWABuilder](https://www.pwabuilder.com/) pwa-starter! Looking to build a new [Progressive Web App](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps) and not sure where to get started? This is what you are looking for! The pwa-starter includes everything you need to start building a production ready PWA and follows all best practices. You get:

- lazy-loaded routes using [@vaadin/router](https://vaadin.com/router).
- A 100 on [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse/), giving you a great starting point for performance and accessibility.
- Use [lit-element](https://lit-element.polymer-project.org/) to build your PWA. lit-element gives you all of the developer experience of React with all   the benefits of Web Components such as smaller bundles for faster load times.
- Includes the [PWABuilder pwa-install component](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-install#pwa-install) for an app store like PWA install experience.
- [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/) for service workers along with the [PWABuilder pwa-update component](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-update#pwa-update) to give your PWA a great offline experience.
- [FAST Components](https://www.fast.design/docs/components/getting-started/) for awesome, pre-built components using the Fluent Design Language.

## Getting Started

### Supported Browsers
- Edge
- Chrome
- Firefox
- Safari

### Prequisites

You will need the following things properly installed on your computer.

* [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) (with NPM)
* [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/get-npm)

You should also be familiar with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) which we use for this project. This helps give you more guidance as you code from [intellisense](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/intellisense) when using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

### Recommended Development setup

We recommend the following tools for your dev setup:

* Editor: [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
* Terminal: [Windows Terminal](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/windows-terminal-preview/9n0dx20hk701?activetab=pivot:overviewtab) or [hyper](https://hyper.is/)
* PWABuilder VSCode extension: [PWABuilder VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=PWABuilder.pwabuilder-extension)
* lit-html VSCode extension: [lit-html VSCode extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bierner.lit-html)

### Development

Run `npm install` and then run `npm run dev`, the starter should open in your default browser. From here you can start developing, your changes will be rebuilt and reloaded in the browser as you develop.

### Building for Production

Make sure the `index.prod.html` and `manifest.json` files are updated to your liking and then run `npm run build`, the `dist/` folder will contain your built PWA. The production build will also generate a pre-caching service worker using [Workbox](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/workbox/modules/workbox-precaching) and handles that service worker using the [PWABuilder pwa-update component](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-update#pwa-update) web component. 

## Deployment and Packaging

### Deployment

Once your PWA is ready to deploy we recommend [Azure static website hosting](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/learn/modules/publish-app-service-static-web-app-api/) for deploying your PWA.


### Packaging

Many app stores, including the Microsoft Store and the Google Play Store support PWAs. To package your PWA for deployment to these app stores head back to https://pwabuilder.com/, put in your URL and hit `Build My PWA`.


## Dual Screen support

The default layout of this starter is dual screen friendly. We do this [here](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter/blob/master/src/script/pages/app-home.ts#L41) by using the [CSS Spanning API](https://github.com/MicrosoftEdge/MSEdgeExplainers/blob/master/Foldables/explainer.md#proposal-css-primitives-for-building-dual-screen-layouts) to adjust the layout when the app is spanned on a dual screen device. As you start to build your PWA you can use these CSS features to ensure that your PWA looks good in all of the [dual screen postures](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/introduction#dual-screen-overview). For more info on developing PWAs for dual screen devices you can check out the [Microsoft docs here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dual-screen/cross-platform/#build-web-experiences). 


## Addons

### Microsoft Graph Toolkit

The [Microsoft Graph Toolkit](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/graph/toolkit/overview) is a collection of reusable, framework-agnostic web components and helpers for accessing and working with Microsoft Graph. The components are fully functional right of out of the box, with built in providers that authenticate with and fetch data from Microsoft Graph.

### Authentication

For Authentication you can use the [PWABuilder pwa-auth](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-auth) web component. This component lets your users sign-in/sign-up using their Microsoft, Google, or Facebook account. Your app receives their email address, name, and profile picture. Built with ‚ù§ by the PWABuilder team.

üòé Bonus: It's super lightweight, pulling in the authentication libraries only when the user tries to sign-in with one.

üòéüòé Double bonus: It uses the new [Credential Management APIs](https://developers.google.com/web/fundamentals/security/credential-management) to speed through sign-ins without bulky pop-ups or redirects.
