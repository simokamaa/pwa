# Welcome to the PWABuilder pwa-starter project, thanks for wanting to contribute! 

In this guide you will get an overview of the contribution workflow from opening an issue, creating a PR, reviewing, and merging the PR.

## Contributing to the starter

### Issues

#### Create a new issue
If you spot a problem with the docs, search if an issue already exists. If a related issue doesn't exist, you can open a new issue using a relevant issue form.

#### Finding an issue
Scan through our existing issues to find one that interests you. You can narrow down the search using labels as filters. See Labels for more information. As a general rule, we donâ€™t assign issues to anyone. If you find an issue to work on, you are welcome to open a PR with a fix.

### Making changes and opening a PR

First, you will need to ensure that you have both [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [Node](https://nodejs.org/) installed. You can check our [documentation here](https://github.com/pwa-builder/pwa-starter/wiki/Getting-Started#getting-started-with-a-local-dev-environment) on how to get your local
dev environment set up. 

Next, you will need to fork the project! Check [here](https://docs.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/fork-a-repo#fork-an-example-repository) to learn how to do this with git.

- First, [clone your fork](https://github.com/git-guides/git-clone) and then [create a new branch](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Branching-Basic-Branching-and-Merging).
- Then, you are ready to make your changes.
- Next, test your changes locally and ensure that both `npm run dev` and `npm run build` do not error.
- Finally, [commit your changes](https://github.com/git-guides/git-commit) to your branch in your fork

At this point you are now ready to make a pull request, which you can learn how to do [here](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork).

After your Pull Request is opened, a member of the PWABuilder team will review and merge your PR! You can follow the progress on the thread of your PR.
